Task 5 - Signing and Verifying

To determine the correct file, I ran the command:
	openssl dgst -sha256 -verify  <(openssl x509 -in task5_public.pem  -pubkey -noout) -signature task5_message_sig.sha256 task5_message#.txt

With each of the three given messages (replacing the # with 1, 2, or 3).

Upon running the command for task5_message3.txt I received the message 'Verified OK


To sign the correct file, I simply ran the command:
	openssl dgst -sha256 -sign rsa.private -out task5.sig task5_message3.txt

Where rsa.private is my private key from Task 4 and task5.sig is the output signature file
