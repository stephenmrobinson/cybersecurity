Task 3 - Question 3

Working with parameters:
	G = (5, 1)
	p = 17
	a = 2
	b = 2
	n = 19

a) Assume "Bob" selected the secret number "beta"= 2. What is the point B?
	B = (2)G
	  = (6, 3)

b) Assume "Alice" selected the secret number "alpha"= 18. What is the point A?
	A = (18)G
	  = (5, 16)

c) Show that Bob and Alice will get the same point P, even though Bob does not
know alpha and Alice does not know beta, but they both know A and B?

Alice first receives Bob's B point and does the following computation:
	(alpha)B = (18)B
		 = 18 (2 G)
		 = (36) G
		 = (17) G
		 = (6, 14) = point P

Bob likewise receives Alice's A point and does the following computation:
	(beta)A = (2)A
		= 2 (18 G)
		= (36) G
		= (17) G
		= (6, 14) = point P
